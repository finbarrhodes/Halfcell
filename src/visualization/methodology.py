This backtester uses a two-stage model to separate FR availability revenue from energy
arbitrage revenue without double-counting the same physical capacity:

- **Stage 1 — Day-ahead capacity allocation:** For each day D, the model decides how
  many MW to commit to FR services vs hold back for arbitrage. Two signals are compared
  using information available at end of day D-1:
    - **FR value per MW**: the confirmed clearing price for day D from the EAC day-ahead
      auction (which clears on D-1), summed across all selected services and EFA blocks.
      No forecasting is needed — this price is already known.
    - **Shadow arb value per MW**: a per-unit estimate of the net arbitrage profit for
      day D, derived from the same price forecast used for dispatch:
      `(avg_discharge − avg_charge / η − cycling_cost) × duration_h`.

  Capacity is then allocated proportionally:
  `fr_fraction = fr_value / (fr_value + arb_value)`,
  so more MW flows toward whichever stream looks more attractive on that day —
  without all-or-nothing switching.

- **Stage 2 — Intraday dispatch:** Within the allocated arbitrage MW, the selected
  dispatch strategy (Perfect Foresight, Naive, or ML) schedules charge/discharge against
  forecast prices and realises revenue against actual day-D prices.

The dispatch strategy is applied consistently to both stages: the same price signal that
drives dispatch also drives the shadow arb estimate in the allocation step.

In Stage 2, the MPC dispatch engine (described below) tracks SoC continuously at
30-minute resolution, enforcing the FR headroom band `[10%, 90%]` as a hard constraint
at every step of the planning horizon. The remaining simplification is that Stage 1
capacity allocation is a daily heuristic rather than being jointly co-optimised with the
intraday LP — see Known Limitations below.

st.markdown(
    """
Intraday dispatch is driven by a **rolling Model Predictive Control (MPC) linear
programme (LP)**, re-solved at every 30-minute settlement period. At each period *t* the
LP plans over a 48-hour (96-period) horizon, returns only the first period's
charge/discharge decision, then re-solves next period — a classic receding-horizon
approach that reflects real operational constraints (the decision must be made before
future prices are known).

**LP formulation.** Decision variables are charge power *p_chg[t]*, discharge power
*p_dis[t]*, and state of charge *SoC[t+1]* for each of the H horizon periods. The
objective maximises net arbitrage revenue minus cycling degradation cost:

`maximise  Σ price[t] × (p_dis[t] − p_chg[t]) × 0.5 h  −  cycling_cost × Σ p_dis[t] × 0.5 h`

subject to:
- SoC state equation with round-trip efficiency applied on the charge side
- FR feasibility band `[10%, 90%]` of capacity enforced as a **hard constraint** at all
  H+1 SoC points, forcing the battery to pre-condition its SoC for upcoming FR delivery
  obligations
- Power bounded to the residual MW available for arbitrage after FR commitment in each
  period

Mutual exclusion of simultaneous charge and discharge is handled via LP relaxation:
since the objective penalises cycling, simultaneous charge+discharge is never optimal
at a positive spread, so no binary variables are required. The LP is solved with the
**CLARABEL** interior-point solver, bundled with cvxpy ≥ 1.4.0
([Diamond & Boyd, 2016](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-408.html)).

**Three price signals are benchmarked** — all three run the identical MPC dispatch
engine; only the price forecast fed to the LP differs:

| Strategy | Price signal fed to LP | What it represents |
|---|---|---|
| **Perfect Foresight** | Actual day-D wholesale prices | Theoretical revenue ceiling — achievable only with advance knowledge of the future |
| **Naive (D-1 prices)** | Yesterday's 48 half-hourly prices | Zero-skill floor — the simplest possible baseline; any real model must beat this |
| **ML Model** | Random Forest forecast for day D | Realistic best case using features available at end of day D-1 |

Dispatch decisions are executed unconditionally at actual prices. Per-period revenue can
be negative when forecast error causes an unfavourable trade — this is the realistic
operational outcome and is intentional.

The **foresight ratio** (realised revenue ÷ perfect-foresight revenue) summarises how much
of the theoretical ceiling each strategy achieves. For LP-based joint co-optimisation

GB frequency response auctions clear below zero more often than is widely appreciated:
**13.5% of auction records in this dataset (8,134 of 60,054) have a negative clearing
price**, concentrated in DR High (5,205 records) and DM High (2,816). As the storage
fleet has grown, procurement volumes have been outpaced and the High-side services in
particular have tipped into oversupply.

**These are included in revenue.** Negative prices are a real feature of a maturing
flexibility market, and excluding them overstates FR income — by roughly 12% of total
modelled revenue on this dataset. Earlier versions floored clearing prices at zero,
which silently removed those records; the floor is now opt-in via the `min_price`
parameter rather than a default.

**Capacity allocation treats them differently, and deliberately so.** The Stage 1
allocator splits each EFA block's capacity in proportion to the value of each stream.
Capacity cannot rationally be allocated *toward* negative expected value, so the FR
signal used for the split is clamped at zero. Two consequences:

- A block whose services net out negative receives **no** FR commitment — the capacity
  is released to arbitrage instead. It earns nothing from FR either way, and committing
  it would bind the dispatch LP to the FR SoC band for no return.
- A block that nets out positive but contains a negative leg (5,178 of 10,773 blocks)
  **is** committed, and the negative leg is netted into revenue. This models an operator
  bidding a service stack that is profitable overall while carrying one loss-making
  component — rather than one that cherry-picks each leg after the fact.

Without the clamp the proportional split is not well defined: a negative numerator
produces negative committed MW, which propagates into the LP's power bounds, and the
denominator can cross zero and make the fraction unbounded.

DR High is the clearest example of why negative prices had to be included rather than
floored. Taken alone it looks like a loss-making service; in context it is not.

| Year | DRH mean | DRL mean | DRH negative | DR pair (H+L) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 | +£11.53 | +£13.00 | 0% | +£24.52 |
| 2023 | +£1.10 | +£10.66 | 14% | +£11.75 |
| 2024 | −£4.80 | +£8.18 | 88% | +£3.38 |
| 2025 | −£2.42 | +£13.21 | 77% | +£10.79 |
| 2026 | −£8.31 | +£16.41 | 92% | +£8.10 |

*All figures £/MW/h.*

DRH has cleared negative in the large majority of blocks since 2024, reaching 92% in 2026 —
while DRL has strengthened over the same period. **The pair, however, remains reliably
positive**: +£8.10/MW/h in 2026, with fewer than 11% of blocks negative as a pair.

Two pieces of evidence indicate the market prices DR as a package rather than as two
independent services:

- **Cleared volumes are matched.** DRH and DRL clear within 5% of each other on 77% of
  blocks since 2025 (median difference 20 MW), against 52% for DM and 49% for DC.
- **The two legs are negatively correlated** (ρ = −0.21) — the split moves while the sum
  stays comparatively stable, the signature of a package price divided between two legs.

The mechanism is the 60-minute sustained delivery requirement, against 15 minutes for DC
and 30 for DM. A provider holding a DR position must keep SoC near the midpoint to honour
either direction for the full window, so committing to one leg commits the asset's SoC
posture to both, and the market clears the package asymmetrically.

**Reading the revenue breakdown.** A negative DR High figure is not a service to drop —
dropping it means not participating in DR at all. The service selector allows DRH and DRL
to be toggled independently, which is useful for attribution but does not correspond to a
strategy an operator could run.

The correlation with renewable output runs the way the mechanism predicts: DRH prices are
*positively* correlated with daily renewable share (ρ = +0.43) while DRL is weakly negative
(ρ = −0.18). DRH is the charge leg — the service that answers an over-frequency excursion —
and heavy renewable output is precisely what pushes the system toward surplus and
over-frequency, so the charge leg gains value on windy days even while clearing from a
negative base. Demand for the discharge leg does not track wind the same way, which is what
DRL's mild negative correlation reflects.

- Applied to imbalance arbitrage trades only: `configured cycling wear cost (£/MWh) × MWh discharged per trade`.

- *Why cycling matters beyond cost:* lithium-ion cells degrade through two primary
  mechanisms that accelerate with use — SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) layer growth,

    """
The ML strategy uses a **Random Forest regressor** to predict the 48 half-hourly APXMIDP
prices for day D using features available at the end of day D-1.

*Why Random Forest?* The feature set is tabular (lagged prices, generation mix ratios,
temporal encodings) rather than raw sequences; they require no feature scaling; they are
robust on datasets of this size; and they provide interpretable feature importances. This
choice is consistent with the electricity price forecasting literature, which finds that
tree-based methods perform competitively against deep learning approaches on short-horizon
day-ahead forecasting tasks, particularly when training data is limited
([Lago et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116983);
[Weron, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.08.008)). An LSTM was considered
but is likely overkill given the training data size and would be harder to explain. A
naive D-1 lag model sets the zero-skill baseline.

**Features used (all available at end of day D-1):**
- Same-period lagged prices: price at the same settlement period 1, 2, and 7 days prior
- Previous-day price statistics: mean, standard deviation, max, and min across all 48 periods
- Generation mix (daily, from D-1): total generation, renewable fraction, fossil fraction,
  and per-fuel breakdown (gas, wind, nuclear, hydro, etc.)
- Cyclical temporal encodings: settlement period, day-of-week, and day-of-year encoded
  as sin/cos pairs to preserve circularity (e.g. period 48 and period 1 are adjacent)
- Weekend flag and UK bank holiday flag
- **GB BESS fleet capacity** (`bess_fleet_mw`, monthly MW): total operational GB
  battery storage capacity at the time of the settlement date, sourced from the
  DESNZ Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD). Captures the structural shift
  as a growing fleet competes for the same arbitrage spreads — from ~0.9 GW at
  end-2019 to ~5.0 GW by March 2026.

  REPD is a *planning* database published quarterly, which has two consequences.
  First, recent months are revised upward as projects are confirmed operational:
  the Q4 2025 extract put March 2026 at 3.4 GW, while the Q2 2026 extract puts the
  same month at 5.0 GW. Figures for the most recent year should be read as
  provisional. Second, the extract always lags the half-hourly price data, so the
  trailing months are projected forward from a 12-month linear trend, anchored at
  the last measured value to keep the cumulative series monotonic. Projected months
  are flagged `is_extrapolated` in `bess_fleet_capacity.parquet`; as of the Q2 2026
  extract, 5 of 92 months (April–August 2026) are projected rather than measured.
  Months before the first REPD entry are zero; months after the last carry the most
  recent measured capacity forward rather than dropping to zero.
- **BESS spread suppression** (`bess_spread_suppression`): `bess_fleet_mw / gen_total` —
  BESS penetration as a fraction of total system generation. Directly encodes the
  economic mechanism: as penetration grows, batteries charge in cheap periods and
  discharge in expensive ones, flattening the merit order and compressing the spreads
  that arbitrage revenue depends on. Near-zero in 2019; a material signal by 2024–25.

**Train/test split:** strict temporal split — training data ends before 2025-03-01
to prevent any look-ahead bias. The model never sees future prices during training.
Training uses an expanding window covering 2019-01-19 to 2025-02-28 (6.1 years,
~105,000 half-hourly observations); the held-out test period runs from 2025-03-01
to the end of the data, currently ~1.5 years and 19% of all observations. The split
date is held fixed as the data is extended, so each refresh adds to the out-of-sample
period rather than to training — and the test window stays longer than a full year,
so seasonal performance can be assessed across a complete annual cycle.

**Known limitations:** tree-based models cannot extrapolate beyond the price ranges seen
during training; electricity price forecasting is inherently noisy; and the model improves
dispatch quality on average but does not eliminate forecast error on individual days.

Model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) and feature importances for the currently selected
model are shown in the **Strategy Comparison** tab of the Revenue Backtester.

**Not yet modelled:**
- Intraday / day-ahead market trading (APXMIDP used as a proxy; DA auction data not yet integrated)
- Balancing Mechanism (BM) direct trading
- Real-time dispatch constraints or grid connection limits

**Known approximations in the current MPC LP:**
- *Rolling horizon is not globally optimal.* A single LP solved over the full backtest
  period would yield higher revenue in theory, but the rolling approach is used because
  it reflects real operational constraints — the dispatch decision must be made before
  future prices are known.
- *LP relaxation of charge/discharge mutual exclusion.* The LP does not use binary
  variables to prohibit simultaneous charging and discharging. This is not a binding
  limitation in practice: since the objective penalises cycling, simultaneous
  charge+discharge is never optimal at a positive spread.
- *Stage 1 capacity allocation is a daily heuristic.* The FR/arbitrage MW split is
  determined once per day by comparing confirmed FR clearing prices against a
  shadow arbitrage value. A fully joint formulation would co-optimise the allocation and
  intraday dispatch simultaneously in a single LP/MIP — see
  [Swierczynski et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14248365) and
  [Bai et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261924015149).

**Battery degradation (not yet modelled):**
In practice, a BESS asset degrades over its operational life through two primary
mechanisms: calendar ageing (capacity fade even at rest) and cycle ageing (accelerated
by depth of discharge, C-rate, and temperature). A more complete model would:
- Track state-of-health (SoH) over the backtest horizon, reducing usable capacity as
  the asset ages.
- Apply a degradation-aware dispatch policy that trades off short-term revenue against
  long-term cycle-life consumption — more aggressive dispatch earns more today but
  shortens asset life and residual value.
- Incorporate chemistry-specific degradation curves (NMC, LFP, etc.), which have
  materially different cycle-life profiles.

The cycling wear cost parameter is a simplified financial proxy for this effect, but it
does not capture the compounding, path-dependent nature of real battery degradation.
This is a natural next step for a more mature model.
